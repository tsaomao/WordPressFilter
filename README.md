# WordPressFilter
For a filter to keep WordPress from displaying "Just in time ads" on the WordPress dashboard. For example, the closeable banner that displays, suggesting that VaultPress backup solution (provided by Automattic) be enabled before upgrading the product. The patch tracked here was suggested by Automattic support resources, whom I originally contacted via the support contact form.

This repo just tracks functions.php, which is from WordPress 4.8.2. Initial commit is the standard version of functions.php. Later commits will include changes suggested by Automattic.

functions.php resides in (WP root folder)/wp-includes/functions.php
